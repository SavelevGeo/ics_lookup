# International Chronostratigraphic Chart
python algorithms querying geological time scale via an age in Ma

At the moment, only a Google Colab notebook is created.

The plans are:
* use more up-to-date-data from https://github.com/CGI-IUGS/timescale-data or https://github.com/i-c-stratigraphy/interactive-geological-timescale
* upgrade Google Colab notebook to response in a more grapgical way
* create a python module
* create a more straightforward web page for the lookup

the data is aquired from https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/interactive-geological-timescale and corresponds to the 2018 year verion of the chart
