# International Chronostratigraphic Chart
python algorithms querying geological time scale via an age in Ma

At the moment, only a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SavelevGeo/ics_lookup/blob/main/ics_request.ipynb) is created.

The plans are:
* use more up-to-date-data from https://github.com/CGI-IUGS/timescale-data or https://github.com/i-c-stratigraphy/interactive-geological-timescale
* move Google Colab Notebook to a github gist, as it would be possible to edit it in-place
* upgrade Google Colab notebook to response in a more grapgical way
* create a python module
* create a more straightforward web page for the lookup

the data is aquired from https://github.com/CSIRO-enviro-informatics/interactive-geological-timescale and corresponds to the 2018 year verion of the chart
